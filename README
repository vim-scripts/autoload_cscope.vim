This Vim plugin is based on prior work from a number of authors. See the
cscope_helper.vim comment header block for details.

Save this file as ~/.vim/plugin/cscope_helper.vim so you can invoke vim/gvim in
subdirectories and still get cscope.out loaded.

A prerequisite for use is that an initial Cscope database has been generated.
Cscope can be executed on the command line, or a script like cscope_db_gen can
be used to generate the database. See https://github.com/dnygren/cscope_db_gen
for an example of how to generate a Cscope database for C/C++.

This plugin will automatically load a cscope.out database (created manually in
the base directory of a source code file tree) into Vim when you open a file.

It performs a search starting at the directory that the edited file is in,
checking the parent directories until it finds the cscope.out file. Therefore
you can start editing a file deep in a project directory, and it will find the
correct Cscope database. It will also automatically update the cscope database
after file saves. If new files are created, the cscope.out database must be
recreated manually.

Keystroke macros and a pull down menu are provided to invoke the Cscope
functions.

A cheatsheet is provided to assist in executing the keystroke macros.
