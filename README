This Vim plugin is based on prior work from a number of authors. See the
autoload_cscope.vim comment header block for details.

This plugin will automatically load cscope.out databases (created separately)
into Vim when you open a file.

It performs a search starting at the directory that the edited file is in,
checking the parent directories until it finds the cscope.out file. Therefore
you can start editing a file deep in a project directory, and it will find the
correct Cscope database. Keystroke macros and a pull down menu are provided to
invoke the Cscope functions.

A cheatsheet is provided to assist in executing the keystroke macros.
