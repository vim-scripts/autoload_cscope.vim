This Vim plugin is based on prior work from a number of authors. See the
autoload_cscope.vim comment header block for details.

This plugin will automatically load a cscope.out database (created manually in
the base directory of a source code file tree) into Vim when you open a file.

It performs a search starting at the directory that the edited file is in,
checking the parent directories until it finds the cscope.out file. Therefore
you can start editing a file deep in a project directory, and it will find the
correct Cscope database.

It will also automatically update the cscope database after file saves. If new
files are created, the cscope.out database must be recreated manually.

Keystroke macros and a pull down menu are provided to invoke the Cscope
functions.

A cheatsheet is provided to assist in executing the keystroke macros.
