"""""""""""""" Jason Duell's Cscope/Vim Key Mappings Cheat Sheet """""""""""""""
" (Based on http://cscope.sourceforge.net/cscope_maps.vim with light edits.)
" The following maps all invoke one of the following Cscope search types:
"
"   's'   symbol    Find all references to the token under cursor
"   'g'   global    Find global definition(s) of the token under cursor
"   'c'   calls     Find all calls to the function name under cursor
"   'd'   called    Find functions that function under cursor calls
"   't'   text      Find all instances of the text under cursor
"   'e'   egrep     Find egrep pattern for the word under cursor
"   'f'   file      Open the filename under cursor
"   'i'   includes  Find files that include the filename under cursor
"
" The starting keys for the searches are:
" CTRL-\ (Control Backslash) jumps the whole Vim window to the search result,
" CTRL-H (Control H) splits the Vim window horizontally to display the result,
" CTRL-V (Control V) splits the Vim window vertically to display the result.
" CTRL-T (Control T) jumps back to where the search began.
"
" To do the first type of search, hit 'CTRL-\', followed by one of the Cscope
" search types above (s,g,c,d,t,e,f,i). Use CTRL-T to go back to where the
" searching began. The second and third types of search use CTRL-H or CTRL-V
" to split the window horizontally or vertically to display the search result.
