"""""""""""""" Jason Duell's Cscope/Vim Key Mappings Cheat Sheet """""""""""""""
" (From http://cscope.sourceforge.net/cscope_maps.vim with light edits. )
" The following maps all invoke one of the following Cscope search types:
"
"   's'   symbol:   find all references to the token under cursor
"   'g'   global:   find global definition(s) of the token under cursor
"   'c'   calls:    find all calls to the function name under cursor
"   't'   text:     find all instances of the text under cursor
"   'e'   egrep:    egrep search for the word under cursor
"   'f'   file:     open the filename under cursor
"   'i'   includes: find files that include the filename under cursor
"   'd'   called:   find functions that function under cursor calls
"
" The starting keys for the searches are:
" CTRL-\ (Control Backslash) which just jumps to your search result,
" CTRL-_ (Control Underscore, i.e. CTRL-Shift-Dash) splits the Vim window,
" CTRL-_CTRL-_ (Control Underscore twice) splits the Vim window vertically.
"
" To do the first type of search, hit 'CTRL-\', followed by one of the Cscope
" search types above (s,g,c,t,e,f,i,d). Use CTRL-t to go back to where the
" searching began. The second and third types of search use CTRL-_ and then
" and CTRL-_ twice respectively. The result of your Cscope search will be
" displayed in the current window.
